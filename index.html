                <h2>IT</h2>
                <p>Currently I'm learning how to make websites but I'm already also creating them, like this you are reading now. I'm mostly working with PHP and JavaScript to create my websites, and of course I also use MySQL for database to manage it with my PHP code. I already have experience in modding videogames, also diagnosis and repairing my computers.</p>

                <h2>CAD-CAM</h2>
                <p>I have some experience with the most used CAD programs in the industry, such as Solid EDGE & AutoCAD. As a hobby, I can make 3D models and with a 3D printer, I can make these projects a reality.<br>As a manufacturing technician, I have earned some experience about how a manufacturer works, how to handle production projects, managing raw materials for production.</p>

                <h2>Photography</h2>
                <p>Later I want to do more professional photos, but right now, I can catch the visions about some great landscapes.<br>I love taking urban, natural and artistic photos. If you want to check my photos, you can see them on my <a href="https://www.instagram.com/unclebenfact/" target="_blank">Instagram</a> page.</p>

                <h2>Creating content</h2>
                <p>As a hobby side project, I started doing some streams on Twitch where I played some retro & modern classic videogames a few years ago. This project later started growing to a higher level, where I learned about how to digitize videogame consoles from the old analog era. Meanwhile, I learned to design and make great videos and pictures.</p>
